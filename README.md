# data-sourcing-challenge
# Module 6 Challenge
# Background
# You've been tasked to prepare some data for a recommendation system to help people find movie reviews and related movies. # You will extract data from two different sources: The New York Times API and The Movie Database, then merge the data together. The text extracted from these APIs can later be used with natural language processing methods.
# Before You Begin
# Before starting the Challenge, be sure to complete the following steps:

# Create a new repository for this project called data-sourcing-challenge. Do not add this homework assignment to an existing repository. When creating your new repository, under the "Add .gitignore" option, make sure you select "Python". This will prevent you from accidentally uploading your API keys in your .env file, exposing them to the world.

# Clone the new repository to your computer.

# Inside your local Git repository, add the starter files retrieve_movie_data.ipynb and example.env from your file downloads.

# Rename example.env to .env and add your API keys to the file.

# Ensure the .env file is not listed when you perform a git status check on the repo, before performing your git add action.

# Push these changes to GitHub or GitLab.
# Instructions
# This Challenge has three parts, and must be completed in order:

# Part 1: Access the New York Times API.

# Part 2: Access The Movie Database API.

# Part 3: Merge and Clean the Data for Export.

# The starter code includes importing the required dependencies and your API keys from your .env file, but you will need to ensure your API keys are added to that file.

# Export data to a CSV file without the DataFrame's index.

# Code source used from Class Activities for examples and Pandas website.
